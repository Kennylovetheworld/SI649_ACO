				<h2> <em>Ant Colony Optimization</em> (ACO) visualization <br>
					for the <em>Travelling Salesman Problem</em> (TSP)</h2>
			</div>
			<p>
				This visualization present a classical ACO algorithm as a solution for the TSP problem. <br>
				The <em>target of TSP problem</em> can be discribed as follow: <br>
				<strong> Given a complete graph of vertices (where each vertices represent a city and every pair of vertices has a weighted edge between them), 
				find the shortest path that visits all cities and returns to the origin city. </strong>
				You can find more info on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">Wikipedia</a>
			</p>
			<p>
				Comparing with an exhaustive searching approach (large time complecity) and greedy approach (bad stability, easy to conclude at local optimization), 
				the ACO algorithm successfully achieve the target more efficiently. The ACO algorithm is inspired by the natural ants' behaviour of leaving pheromones on their way to help companion.<br>
				There are vairous version of ACO algorithm like Ant Colony System (ACS), Elitist Ant System, Max-Min Ant System (MMAS) and etc.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Brief introduction to three general steps for ACO algorithm: 
			</h3>
			<UL>
				<LI><strong>First</strong>, the algorithm generates a certain number of <em>Ant</em>. Each of the <em>Ant</em> stochastically generates a path that depends on the probability of each edges.
					The probabilities is usually constructed by the pheromones on the edges, length of the edges and factors for exploration/exploitation ratio. 
					Different variants of ACO have different strategies when calculating the probabilities. Generally, pheromones on the edges will increase the probability, 
					while weight of the edges will panalize the probability. 
				<LI><strong>Second</strong>, total length of trails, found by different <em>Ants</em>, is caluated in this step. Rank-based ACO strategies (one kind of ACO algorithm) ranked all solutions in this step, 
					while others only find out the best trails with one iteration.   
				<LI><strong>Third</strong>, the algorithm updates the pheromones levels of every edges in this stop, by collecting and compareing the solutions from all the ants in second step.
					Conventionally, pheromone increment is only applied on the trail of the shortest path (ant's solution) in this iteration. 
					Nevertheless, different variants of ACO algorithm has various detailed updating strategies within this step. For instance, in spite of the local best <em>Ant</em>, 
					the Max-Min Ant System also allow the global best <em>Ant</em> to leave pheromones in every iterations.
