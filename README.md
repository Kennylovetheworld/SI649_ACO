# Ant Colony Optimization - TSP

And experimental ant colony system visualization for solving the travelling salesman problem. Just because it is fun.

This is a SI649 Project

I used the implement of ACO algorithm is based on Jeremy Tuloup's github public repository "aco-tsp".

In this homework, I mainly redesign the visualization of the algorithm. Have fun!
